# Jupyter-notebooks

Some small python projects on my jupyter notebooks:

1.Auto file sorter.ipynb

Auto file sorter could sorter the files in the path into different folders according to its types.

2. Grab Table from wikipedia.ipynb with three csv files

Here is the original wikipedia source: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_in_the_United_States_by_revenue

I grab all three lists from this web and turn them into csv files
